# WebIDE - a web-based code editor

![WebIDE Home Page Layout, screenshot taken at 30th December, 2022](./public/layout.jpeg)

This project will be my first (or maybe only) project in 2023. 

WebIDE is a web-based code editor which designed to save, load, write and also compile codes. MySQL database will be used in this project.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Codex](https://github.com/Jaagrav/CodeX), which made by [Jaagrav](https://github.com/Jaagrav). For this project to be different, I will include a database to save all source files and also user data on a server so all files can be accessed at every time.
